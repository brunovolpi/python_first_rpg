This has studies objectives and having some coding fun
Right now at this moment I am making classes (jobs) to interact with other classes (monsters).
This interactions resides on combat, hability choice/use and xp accumulation for level up.
At each lvl stats are raised, such as life, mana, strenght and etc.
My next objective is to create a storyline so I can fit those maths.

Btw I am a very inexperient coder, every help is pretty much welcome.

At this moment in time I'm trying to debug the combat messages for mages when lvl 5 is reached.
A new skill is added and naturally one more combat choise is available.
